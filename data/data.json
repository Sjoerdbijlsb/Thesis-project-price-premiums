Bruce Kilgore designed his first basketball shoe for Nike, he had no idea it would be reinvented innumerable times over the coming decades. The Nike Women’s Air Force 1 '07 Mid ‘Tokyo 2003' is a lavish celebration of this iconic court shoe, with a vivid violet Swoosh, tongue tag and ankle strap. Violet faux-croc embossed overlays in Viotech pop against a Summit White leather upper. The rubber cupsole underfoot is boosted by Nike Air cushioning. A salute to Tokyo culture is delivered with the embossed 'TYO 03' on the outside
